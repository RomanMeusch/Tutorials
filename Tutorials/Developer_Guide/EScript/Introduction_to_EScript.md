 PADrend Version 1.0.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

EScript is an object-oriented scripting language for controlling C++ applications. It is compiled and executed by a virtual machine. EScript ships with PADrend and can be used for rapid prototyping. It is also possible to run the virtual machine as stand alone application.

## Syntax
The syntax is similar to C and JavaScript, therefore statements always ends with a semicolon and there are two kinds of comments. A single line comment starts with `//` and a multiline comment is enclosed with `/*` and `*/`.
